# Implementation Plan - School Scheduler UI Improvements

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Simplify the UI and integrate advanced generation into the `solver/constraints_manager.html` page with immediate visualization of Class and Teacher grids.

## Phase 1: Backend API Development âœ…

### 1.1 Create Schedule Entries API
- [x] Implement `GET /api/schedule_entries?version=latest`
- [x] Define JSON contract with time_slots, entries, and meta
- [x] Handle teacher_names as array (split if string)
- [x] Add metadata support (solve_status, walltime_sec, advanced)

### 1.2 Enhance Generate Schedule Endpoint
- [x] Modify `POST /generate_schedule` to support `advanced` parameter
- [x] Add constraint parameters (limit_consecutive, avoid_late_hard, etc.)
- [x] Integrate with advanced optimization pipeline if available
- [x] Save metadata to database for status tracking

### 1.3 Database Schema Updates
- [x] Add `metadata` JSONB column to `schedules` table
- [x] Add `subject` column to `schedule_entries` for compatibility
- [x] Add `room`, `time_slot_id`, `id` columns to `schedule_entries`
- [x] Migrate data from `subject_name` to `subject`

## Phase 2: Frontend UI Refactoring âœ…

### 2.1 Layout Structure
- [x] Split layout: 35% constraints panel (left), 65% results panel (right)
- [x] Dark theme with GitHub-style colors (#0b1220, #0f1629)
- [x] Responsive design with minimum widths

### 2.2 Constraints Panel (Left)
- [x] Hard constraints section with checkboxes
- [x] Soft constraints section with checkboxes
- [x] "ðŸš€ Advanced Generation" primary button
- [x] Status display with real-time updates
- [x] Progress bar with animated fill
- [x] Metadata display after generation

### 2.3 Results Panel (Right)
- [x] Tab navigation: "ðŸ“š Classes" and "ðŸ‘¥ Teachers"
- [x] Selector dropdown for class/teacher selection
- [x] Subject filter dropdown
- [x] Action buttons: Export CSV, Print, Reset filters
- [x] Empty state with helpful message
- [x] Timetable grid with days as columns, slots as rows

## Phase 3: Core Functionality âœ…

### 3.1 Generation Workflow
- [x] Collect constraint settings from checkboxes
- [x] POST to `/generate_schedule` with advanced=true
- [x] Show progress bar during generation
- [x] Poll `/api/schedule_entries` for results
- [x] Update status: Queued â†’ Running â†’ Optimal/Feasible/Infeasible
- [x] Display toast notifications for success/error

### 3.2 Data Visualization
- [x] Parse and normalize schedule entries
- [x] Build class and teacher lists from entries
- [x] Render timetable grid with proper day/slot mapping
- [x] Display subject badges with teacher/class info
- [x] Show room information when available

### 3.3 Export & Actions
- [x] CSV export with UTF-8 BOM for Excel
- [x] Include all relevant fields in CSV
- [x] Print functionality with proper formatting
- [x] Filter reset to clear selections

## Phase 4: Polish & UX âœ…

### 4.1 Error Handling
- [x] Handle 500 errors gracefully
- [x] Show appropriate error toasts
- [x] Display INFEASIBLE status clearly
- [x] Timeout handling with user feedback

### 4.2 Persistence
- [x] Save constraint preferences to localStorage
- [x] Restore settings on page load
- [x] Remember active tab selection
- [x] Auto-select first item when data loads

### 4.3 Internationalization
- [x] RTL support with dir="rtl"
- [x] Hebrew locale detection
- [x] Bilingual day names (French/Hebrew)
- [x] Title change based on locale

## Phase 5: Bug Fixes & Optimization âœ…

### 5.1 SQL Query Corrections
- [x] Fix `subject_name` â†’ `subject` compatibility
- [x] Remove DISTINCT with ORDER BY conflict
- [x] Handle NULL time_slot_id properly
- [x] Correct period_number indexing (0 for morning discussion)

### 5.2 Module Import Fixes
- [x] Remove FileHandler with `/logs` path
- [x] Fix advanced_main.py import issues
- [x] Handle missing modules gracefully

### 5.3 Performance
- [x] Set minimum timeout to 600 seconds
- [x] Optimize polling interval (2 seconds)
- [x] Limit progress bar updates

## Testing Checklist âœ…

### Functional Tests
- [x] Generate schedule with advanced mode
- [x] View schedule for each class
- [x] View schedule for each teacher
- [x] Filter by subject
- [x] Export to CSV
- [x] Print schedule
- [x] Reset filters

### UI/UX Tests
- [x] Progress bar animation
- [x] Status updates during generation
- [x] Toast notifications appear/disappear
- [x] Empty state displays correctly
- [x] Tab switching works
- [x] Dropdown selections persist

### Integration Tests
- [x] API endpoints respond correctly
- [x] Database saves metadata
- [x] Schedule entries retrieved properly
- [x] Constraint settings applied

## Deployment Notes

### Docker Configuration
- Ensure PostgreSQL has required columns
- Advanced modules are optional (fallback available)
- Logging uses console only (no file handlers)

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For GPT-4 integration
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude integration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection
- `ENABLE_PARALLEL_TEACHING`: Feature flag

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: Generation completes within 10 minutes
2. **Reliability**: No 500 errors during normal operation
3. **Usability**: Users can generate and view schedules without assistance
4. **Data Integrity**: All 574+ entries display correctly
5. **Export Quality**: CSV files open correctly in Excel with proper encoding

## Current Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All phases successfully implemented and tested. The interface is production-ready with:
- Full advanced generation integration
- Immediate visualization of results
- Robust error handling
- Persistent user preferences
- No dependency on external dashboard
